                    <p class="mb-4">In JavaScript, testing means checking if your code works as it should by running it
                        with different inputs and seeing what comes out. This helps make sure your code does what it's
                        supposed to and catches any problems that might pop up. <br><br>

                        You can test your code by simply running it yourself and watching how it behaves. Or, you can
                        use special tools and frameworks that do the testing automatically. This automated testing is
                        quicker and saves time because you can run it over and over without having to do it all by hand
                        each time.</p>

                                <p>Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a software development methodology that emphasizes
                                    writing tests before writing the actual code. It's a disciplined way of ensuring
                                    your code is reliable, maintainable, and bug-free. Think of it like building a
                                    bridge in a video game: you lay out the blueprints (tests) first, then construct the
                                    bridge (code), and continually test it to make sure itâ€™s sturdy. <br><br></p>

                                <h5 class="anchor" id="tdd-how-it-works">How Does TDD Work?</h5>
                                <p>TDD follows a simple cycle often referred to as <strong>Red-Green-Refactor</strong>.
                                    Here's what each step involves: <br><br>
                                <ol class="p-0">
                                    <li><strong>1. Red:</strong> Write a test for a new feature or functionality you
                                        want to add. At this stage, the test will fail because you haven't implemented
                                        the feature yet.</li>
                                    <div class="inner-explain">Think of it like setting a goal in a video game. You
                                        decide you need to collect a
                                        certain item (the feature), but you haven't gone on the quest yet.</div>
                                    <li><strong>2. Green:</strong> Write just enough code to make the test pass. Your
                                        goal here is to achieve a green checkmark, indicating success.</li>
                                    <div class="inner-explain">This is like embarking on your quest and collecting the
                                        item. You do just enough to complete the objective.</div>
                                    <li><strong>3. Refactor:</strong> Once the test passes, you clean up your code to
                                        make it more efficient and maintainable without changing its functionality. The
                                        test ensures that your code still works after refactoring.</li>
                                    <div class="inner-explain">In video game terms, this is like optimizing your
                                        inventory or upgrading your equipment after completing the quest to make sure
                                        you're in the best shape for future challenges.</div>
                                </ol>
                                </p>
                                <h5 class="m-0 p-0 anchor" id="tdd-examples">Examples of TDD</h5>
                                <p class="mt-2">Let's walk through a simple example. Suppose you want to write a
                                    function that adds two numbers. <br><br>
                                    <strong>1. Red:</strong> Write the test
                                <pre><code class="language-javascript mb-2">// add.test.js
const add = require('./add');

test('adds 1 + 2 to equal 3', () => {
  expect(add(1, 2)).toBe(3);
});</code></pre>
                                At this point, if you run the test, it will fail because you haven't written the add
                                function yet. <br><br>
                                <div class="mt-2 mb-3"><strong>2. Green:</strong> Write the code to make the test pass
                                </div>
                                <pre><code class="language-javascript mb-2">// add.js
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

module.exports = add;</code></pre>
                                Now, if you run the test, it should pass because the add function correctly adds two
                                numbers.<br><br>
                                <div class="mt-2 mb-4"><strong>3. Refactor:</strong> Improve your code (if necessary)
                                </div>
                                In this simple example, the code is already pretty clean. However, if you had more
                                complex logic, this is where you'd refactor it to ensure readability and
                                maintainability.
                                </p>

                                <div class="d-flex flex-column gap-2 mb-5">
                                    <div>
                                        <strong>Improved Code Quality:</strong> Since you test as you go, you catch
                                        issues early and spend less time debugging later.
                                    </div>
                                    <div>
                                        <strong>Less Debugging:</strong> Writing tests first ensures that you think
                                        about the requirements and edge cases upfront.
                                    </div>
                                    <div>
                                        <strong>Documentation:</strong> Tests serve as documentation, showing how the
                                        code is supposed to work.
                                    </div>
                                    <div>
                                        <strong>Confidence:</strong> Refactoring becomes safer because you have tests
                                        that guarantee your changes don't break existing functionality.
                                    </div>
                                </div>
                                <h5 class="mt-5 mb-3 p-0 anchor" id="tdd-in-web">TDD in Web Development</h5>
                                <div class="d-flex flex-column gap-2 mb-5">
                                    In web development, TDD can be particularly useful for ensuring that both your front-end and back-end code work correctly. For example:
                                    <div class="mt-3">
                                        <strong>Front-End:</strong> You might write tests to ensure that user interactions (like button clicks) produce the expected changes in the UI.
                                    </div>
                                    <div>
                                        <strong>Back-End:</strong> You might write tests to ensure that your API endpoints return the correct data and handle errors properly.
                                    </div>
                                    <h5 class="mt-5 mb-3 p-0">Conclusion</h5>
                                    <div>TDD is like a game plan that helps you build reliable and bug-free software. By writing tests first, you ensure that your code meets its requirements and behaves as expected, making your development process smoother and more efficient. Just like in a video game, you set your goals (tests), achieve them (write code to pass tests), and then refine your strategy (refactor) to be prepared for future challenges.</div>
