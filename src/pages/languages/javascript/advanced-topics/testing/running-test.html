                                <h4 class="mt-4" id="create">1. Creating (describe/it)</h4>
                                <div>In Mocha, you can organize your tests using the <span
                                        class="inject">'describe'</span> function and create individual tests with the
                                    <span class="inject">'it'</span> function. Let's break down what these two elements
                                    do.
                                    <li class="circle mt-3"><span class="inject">'describe'</span>: This block is used to
                                        group related tests. It takes a string describing the group and a callback
                                        function containing the tests.</li>
                                    <li class="circle mb-3"><span class="inject">'it'</span>: Defines an individual test
                                        case.
                                        It takes a string describing the test and a callback function containing the
                                        test logic.</li>
                                </div>
                                <div>Let'stake a look at what this looks like when implemented.</div>
                                <pre><code class="language-javascript my-4">describe('String Utility', () => {
  describe('.toUpperCase', () => {
    it('should convert all characters to uppercase', () => {
      // Your test goes here
    });
    it('should return an empty string when called on an empty string', () => {
      // Your test goes here
    });
  });
});</code></pre>
                                <div>In this example, we are testing the <span class="inject">'toUpperCase'</span> method
                                    of a hypothetical String Utility. This method should convert all characters in a
                                    string to uppercase and handle the case of an empty string.</div>
                                <div class="mt-2">The <span class="inject">'describe'</span> and <span
                                        class="inject">'it'</span> functions both take two arguments: a descriptive string
                                    and a callback function. While these functions offer flexibility, they are usually
                                    utilized in a specific way: <span class="inject">'describe'</span> blocks are nested
                                    to mirror the structure of your implementation code, and <span
                                        class="inject">'it'</span> blocks are used to write individual tests. This method
                                    helps create a test suite that is modular, maintainable, and clear.</div>

                                <h4 class="mt-5" id="writing">2. Writing (assert)</h4>
                                <div>When it comes time to actually write your tests, we will use the <span
                                        class="inject">'assert.ok'</span> method which is conveniently provided by
                                    Node.js. <br>
                                    The function of tests are used to run a function and compare the result to what is
                                    the expected outcome. Let's look at what we may be familiar with and how we'd use
                                    our assert method.</div>
                                <pre><code class="language-javascript my-4">const x = 3 * 3;</code></pre>
                                <div>Here, we know that the value of <span class="inject">'x'</span> would equal
                                    <strong>9</strong>. Traditionally if we were wanting to check this value, we could
                                    use an <span class="inject">'if'</span> statement to check the value is expected.
                                </div>
                                <pre><code class="language-javascript my-4">if (x !== 9) {
    throw 'Failure: x does not equal 9';                                    
};</code></pre>
                                <div>With <span class="inject">'assert.ok'</span> however, we can simplifiy this process
                                    as it allows the comparison of values and throws errors if necessary in a single
                                    function call. This can be imported into your file by using <span
                                        class="inject">'const assert = require('assert');'</span>. Now our function would
                                    look like this.</div>
                                <pre><code class="language-javascript my-4">const assert = require('assert');
assert.ok(x === 9);</code></pre>
                                <div>We know that <strong>9</strong> is our expected outcome, so in this scenario, an
                                    error would not be thrown. If we ended up with a difference in the expected outcome,
                                    an <span class="inject">'AssertionError'</span> would be throw. This would advise our
                                    program that a test failed and an error message would be logged.</div>

                                <div>When conducting JavaScript testing, it's crucial to divide a test into three
                                    distinct phases: <strong>setup</strong>, <strong>exercise</strong>, and
                                    <strong>verify</strong>. This clear delineation of steps enhances the reliability,
                                    maintainability, and clarity of your tests. <br> <br>
                                    Here's a breakdown of these phases:
                                    <div class="mt-2">
                                        <ul>
                                            <li><strong>Setup</strong>: Initialize objects, variables, and conditions
                                                that are necessary for your test to run.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Exercise</strong>: Execute the functionality that you are
                                                testing.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Verify</strong>: Compare the actual outcomes with the expected
                                                results using an assertion library.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </div>
                                    By distinctly separating these phases, your tests will become more readable, easier
                                    to modify, and simpler to validate. <br><br>
                                    Let's take a look at this in action.
                                    <pre><code class="language-javascript my-4">const assert = require('assert');

describe('.push', () => {
    it('should add an element to the end of an array', () => {
        assert.ok(['Mario', 'Grand Theft Auto', 'Overwatch'].push('Zelda') === 4);
    });
});</code></pre>
                                    vs
                                    <pre><code class="language-javascript my-4">const assert = require('assert');

describe('.push', () => {
    it('should add an element to the end of an array', () => {
        // Setup
        const newGame = 'Zelda'
        const outcome = 4;
        const games = ['Mario', 'Grand Theft Auto', 'Overwatch'];

        // Exercise
        const addGame = games.push(newGame);
        const gameCount = games.length;

        // Verify
        assert.ok(gameCount === outcome);
    });
});</code></pre>
                                    Both of these tests achieve the same outcome of confirming the lengh of the array
                                    after an item was added. However, in terms of readability and understanding, the
                                    second approach makes it much easier to modify and validate.
                                </div>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                    </div> <!-- End of Entry -->

                    <!-- ENTRY -->
                    <div class="section-entry" id="teardown">
                        <div class="section-title">
                            <h3 class="primary-color-dark mb-5">Teardown</h3>
                            <div class="section-card d-flex flex-column">
                                <div>Up to now, we've been writing a single test within an it() block. However, in many
                                    cases, we need to write numerous tests for a particular feature, and these tests are
                                    run one after another. <br><br>

                                    Running multiple tests can create problems if they alter the testing environment, as
                                    modifications in one test might influence the next. Examples of common environmental
                                    changes include:
                                    <br><br>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li class="circle">Modifying global variables or state</li>
                                        <li class="circle">Changing network configurations</li>
                                        <li class="circle">Manipulating user session data</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    To prevent these issues, we often include a teardown step at the end of our tests.
                                    The teardown phase resets the environment, ensuring that each test is isolated
                                    before the next one begins. Although this isn't necessary in every instance, it's
                                    crucial to use when it's needed. This provides two main benefits:
                                    <br><br>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li class="circle">Environmental changes introduced by one test do not impact
                                            the others.</li>
                                        <li class="circle">Isolated tests can be run in any sequence</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </div>
                                <div>
                                    <h4 class="my-3 anchor" id="teardown-usage">Usage</h4>
                                    <div>
                                        Let's say we are testing a simple video game system where players can log in and
                                        log out. We want to ensure that the player state is properly reset after each
                                        test. <br><br>
                                        Here’s a simple implementation of the game functions:
                                        <pre><code class="language-javascript my-4">// game.js
let currentPlayer = null;

function login(playerName) {
  currentPlayer = playerName;
}

function logout() {
  currentPlayer = null;
}

function getCurrentPlayer() {
  return currentPlayer;
}

module.exports = { login, logout, getCurrentPlayer };</code></pre>
                                        Now, we'll write tests for these functions and include a teardown to reset the
                                        player state after each test.
                                        <pre><code class="language-javascript my-4">// test/game.test.js
const assert = require('chai').assert;
const { login, logout, getCurrentPlayer } = require('../game');

describe('Player Login System', function() {
  afterEach(function() {
    logout();
  });

  it('should log in a player', function() {
    login('Player1');
    assert.equal(getCurrentPlayer(), 'Player1');
  });

  it('should log out a player', function() {
    login('Player2');
    logout();
    assert.isNull(getCurrentPlayer());
  });

  it('should return null if no player is logged in', function() {
    assert.isNull(getCurrentPlayer());
  });
});</code></pre>
                                        <h4 class="my-3 anchor" id="teardown-explanation">Explanation</h4>
                                        Let's get an idea what we are looking at with the provided code. <br><br>
                                        Our <strong>Teardown Function</strong> would be the <span class="inject">'afterEach(function() { logout(); });'</span> part of the code. <br><br>
                                        The <span class="inject">'afterEach'</span> function is a Mocha hook that runs after each test case. In this case, it ensures that the <span class="inject">'logout'</span> function is called to reset the <span class="inject">'currentPlayer'</span> state. <br><br>
                                        Our three test were created to ensure that the <span class="inject">'currentPlayer'</span> is correctly set when logged in, logs a character in and out then asserts that the <span class="inject">'currentPlayer'</span> is <span class="inject">'null'</span>, and finally asserts that the <span class="inject">'currentPlayer'</span> is <span class="inject">'null'</span> if no player is logged in. <br><br>
                                        Without the teardown function, the state of <span class="inject">'currentPlayer'</span> could persist between tests, leading to false positives or negatives. By resetting the state after each test, we ensure that each test is isolated and independent, providing accurate results.
